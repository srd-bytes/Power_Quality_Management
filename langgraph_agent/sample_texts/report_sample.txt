    ## Recommendations

    ### Immediate Actions

    - Monitor the feeder for recurrence.
    - Investigate any sudden load changes or short circuits.

    ### Preventive Measures

    - Consider installing a Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) or a voltage stabilizer.
    - Evaluate the presence of large inductive loads.
    - Ensure critical systems are connected through a reliable UPS.
