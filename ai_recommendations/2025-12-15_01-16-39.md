**Fault Details**

**Time:** 2025-12-15_01-16-39
**Type:** Voltage sag
**Location:** BUS 11
**Status:** Ongoing
**Duration:** 20 ms

A voltage sag has been detected at BUS 11. BUS 11 is a critical point in the system, serving as the AC input to a rectifier. It is also connected to LINE10_11 (from BUS10) and LINE11_12 (to BUS12). Voltage (VM11) and current (IM11) measurements are available at this bus.

### Recommendations

1.  **Immediate Action & Monitoring:**
    *   **Verify Sag Magnitude and Phase Involvement:** Utilize the `VM11` measurement to determine the exact voltage drop magnitude and which phases are affected. Confirm the duration using available high-speed data.
    *   **Check Upstream and Downstream Buses:** Monitor voltage measurements at `BUS10` (VM10) and `BUS12` (VM12) to understand the extent and propagation of the sag.
    *   **Rectifier Status Check:** Immediately inspect the operational status of the rectifier connected to `BUS11`. A voltage sag can affect its DC output and potentially trip protective devices.
    *   **Protection System Review:** Ensure that protective devices (e.g., undervoltage relays) associated with `BUS11` and the rectifier are functioning correctly and are set appropriately to isolate sustained faults or protect sensitive equipment without nuisance tripping for transient sags.

2.  **Fault Analysis and Mitigation:**
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigate potential causes of the sag, focusing on the lines connected to `BUS11` (LINE10_11, LINE11_12) and upstream components.
    *   **Power Quality Monitoring Enhancement:** If not already in place, deploy or enhance continuous power quality monitoring equipment at `BUS11` and adjacent buses to capture detailed sag characteristics (magnitude, duration, phase angle changes, imbalance).
    *   **System Stability Study:** Perform a transient stability analysis to understand the system's response to such sags and identify any potential cascading effects, especially considering the impact on the DC system fed by the rectifier.

3.  **Long-Term Solutions:**
    *   **Voltage Support Devices:** Consider installing voltage support devices such as Static Var Compensators (SVC), Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOM), or Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) for critical loads connected downstream of the rectifier, or dynamic voltage restorers (DVRs) at `BUS11` if the sag frequency or impact is significant.
    *   **Grid Reinforcement:** Evaluate the possibility of grid reinforcement or re-configuration (e.g., adding new lines, upgrading transformers) to improve short-circuit strength and reduce sag propagation.
    *   **Equipment Hardening:** For sensitive equipment like the rectifier, consider specifying or upgrading to units with enhanced sag ride-through capability.

### Possible Causes

Voltage sags are typically caused by short-circuit faults in the power system, but can also result from other events. Given `BUS11`'s location and connected equipment, possible causes include:

1.  **Short-Circuit Faults:**
    *   **Fault on LINE10_11 or LINE11_12:** A fault (e.g., phase-to-ground, phase-to-phase, three-phase) on either of these transmission lines connected directly to `BUS11` would cause a significant voltage drop.
    *   **Fault on an adjacent bus (BUS10, BUS12) or their connected lines:** A fault near `BUS10` or `BUS12` could propagate a voltage sag to `BUS11`.
    *   **Fault within the Rectifier or its connected DC components:** While less common to cause an AC bus sag, an internal fault within the rectifier or its immediate AC-side connection could potentially draw excessive current, leading to a sag on `BUS11` before protection operates.
    *   **Fault on a downstream feeder/load:** A fault on a load or feeder connected to `BUS12` could cause a sag that propagates back to `BUS11`.

2.  **Sudden Large Load Changes:**
    *   **Starting of large motors or industrial equipment:** The inrush current drawn by large inductive loads, especially those connected nearby (e.g., at `BUS10` or `BUS12`), can momentarily depress the voltage.
    *   **Energizing large transformers:** Similar to motor starting, energizing a large transformer can draw significant magnetizing inrush current.

3.  **Capacitor Bank Switching:**
    *   While usually improving voltage, improper switching or faults within capacitor banks (if present near `BUS11`) could potentially cause transient voltage disturbances.

4.  **Lightning Strikes:**
    *   A direct or indirect lightning strike can cause transient overvoltages followed by sags due to flashovers and subsequent fault clearing.

5.  **Grid Instability or Remote Faults:**
    *   A fault or significant disturbance further upstream in the `Simulink_14Bus_System` (e.g., near generators `GEN1` or `GEN2` at `BUS2`, `BUS3`) could propagate as a voltage sag to `BUS11`, especially if the system impedance is high.

### IEEE References and Nominal Ranges

*   **Definition of Voltage Sag:**
    *   **IEEE Std. 1159-2019, "IEEE Recommended Practice for Monitoring Electric Power Quality"**: Defines a voltage sag (or dip) as a decrease in RMS voltage or current at the power frequency for durations from 0.5 cycles to 1 minute, to between 0.1 and 0.9 p.u. (per unit) of the nominal voltage.
    *   Given a 20ms duration, for a 60Hz system (1 cycle = 16.67ms), this sag lasts approximately 1.2 cycles, falling squarely within the IEEE 1159 definition. For a 50Hz system (1 cycle = 20ms), this sag lasts approximately 1 cycle.

*   **Nominal Voltage Ranges (Steady-State):**
    *   While sags are deviations, for comparison, typical steady-state voltage operating ranges in power systems are often specified as:
        *   **Transmission Systems:** Usually within ±5% of the nominal voltage (0.95 p.u. to 1.05 p.u.).
        *   **Distribution Systems:** Often within ±10% of the nominal voltage (0.9 p.u. to 1.1 p.u.).
    *   **IEEE Std. 1250-2018, "IEEE Guide for Service to Equipment Sensitive to Network Disturbances"**: Provides guidance on equipment ride-through capabilities during voltage sags.
    *   **IEEE Std. 1668-2017, "IEEE Recommended Practice for the Application of Power Quality Monitoring Equipment"**: Provides guidelines for proper installation and usage of power quality monitors, essential for characterizing sags.

### Possible Damages

A voltage sag, even of short duration like 20ms, can have various detrimental effects on power system components and connected loads, particularly at `BUS11` which feeds a rectifier.

1.  **Rectifier at BUS 11:**
    *   **Reduced DC Output:** The primary impact will be a momentary drop in the rectifier's DC output voltage and current. This can cause issues for any DC loads or systems connected downstream (e.g., DC motor drives, battery charging, control circuits).
    *   **Maloperation or Tripping:** Sensitive rectifiers or their control systems might misoperate or trip protective relays (e.g., undervoltage protection) if the sag magnitude is severe, leading to an interruption of the DC supply.
    *   **Harmonic Distortion:** The rectifier's operation during a sag can temporarily increase harmonic distortion on both the AC and DC sides, stressing components.
    *   **Component Stress:** Repeated sags can stress semiconductor devices (diodes/thyristors) and DC link capacitors within the rectifier due to sudden changes in current and voltage.

2.  **Loads Connected to BUS 12 (via LINE11_12):**
    *   **Equipment Malfunction:** Loads like `LOAD12`, `LOAD13`, `LOAD14` (and potentially `LOAD4`, `LOAD5`, `LOAD7`, `LOAD9`, `LOAD10` further downstream) might experience sags if the voltage drop propagates. This can lead to:
        *   **Process Interruption:** Industrial processes (e.g., manufacturing lines, data centers) can halt or produce faulty products.
        *   **Data Loss:** Computers and control systems can lose data or require rebooting.
        *   **Motor Stalling/Tripping:** AC motors might experience reduced torque, stall, or trip on undervoltage, leading to production downtime and potential mechanical stress upon restart.
    *   **Reduced Lifetime:** Repeated sags can cause thermal cycling and mechanical stress on equipment, potentially reducing their operational lifespan.

3.  **Generators (GEN1, GEN2) and Synchronous Compensators (SYNC_COMP1, SYNC_COMP2, SYNC_COMP3):**
    *   **Loss of Synchronism (Severe Sags):** While less likely for a 20ms sag, a severe sag, especially if it leads to a fault and subsequent clearing, can impact the stability of generators and synchronous compensators. They might experience oscillations or even lose synchronism with the grid.
    *   **Stress on Excitation Systems:** The excitation systems of generators and compensators will work harder to maintain voltage, potentially stressing their components.

4.  **Protection and Control Systems:**
    *   **Nuisance Tripping:** Overly sensitive protection relays might trip unnecessarily for a short-duration sag, leading to wider outages than required.
    *   **Control System Errors:** Microprocessor-based control systems might experience computational errors or resets if their internal DC power supplies are affected by the sag.

5.  **Overall System Stability:**
    *   While a single 20ms sag is typically not a major threat to overall grid stability, frequent or widespread sags can indicate underlying grid weaknesses or issues that could escalate into larger disturbances (e.g., voltage collapse) if not addressed.
