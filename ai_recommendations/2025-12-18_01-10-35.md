**Fault Details:**
*   **Time:** 2025-12-15_01-10-35
*   **Type:** Voltage sag
*   **Location:** BUS 11 (involving nodes BUS11_A, BUS11_B, BUS11_C)
*   **Status:** Ongoing
*   **Duration:** 20 ms

A voltage sag has been detected at BUS 11 of the Simulink_14Bus_System. This bus is connected to LINE10_11, LINE11_12, and the AC side of a rectifier circuit. The sag duration is 20 ms, and the fault is currently ongoing.

### Recommendations

1.  **Immediate Actions:**
    *   **Isolate the Fault:** If the sag is severe and persistent, protection systems should ideally isolate the affected section (BUS 11 and connected lines/equipment) to prevent cascading failures.
    *   **Check Protection Systems:** Verify the proper operation and coordination of protection relays (e.g., undervoltage relays) associated with BUS 11, LINE10_11, LINE11_12, and the rectifier. Ensure they are set to respond appropriately to a 20ms sag.
    *   **Monitor System Parameters:** Continuously monitor voltage and current at BUS 11 (VM11, IM11) and adjacent buses (BUS10, BUS12) to assess the sag's depth, duration, and its impact on the system. Pay attention to the rectifier's input and output.

2.  **Investigation and Analysis:**
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** Determine the exact cause of the voltage sag. This involves analyzing fault recorders, sequence of events, and historical data.
    *   **Equipment Inspection:** Inspect the rectifier components (DIODE_BRIDGE, DC_LINK_CAP) and the DC_LOAD for any signs of stress or malfunction that might have been triggered by or contributed to the sag.
    *   **System Model Review:** Review the system model parameters and protection settings in the Simulink environment to ensure they accurately reflect the physical system and provide adequate response.
    *   **Harmonic Analysis:** Investigate if the rectifier operation or any other loads are introducing harmonics that could exacerbate voltage quality issues.

3.  **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Voltage Support:** Implement or enhance voltage support mechanisms at or near BUS 11. This could include:
        *   Reactive power compensation (e.g., Static Var Compensators (SVC), STATCOMs, or capacitor banks, though none are directly shown at BUS11 in the provided system).
        *   Dynamic Voltage Restorers (DVRs) or Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) for critical loads connected to the rectifier.
    *   **Protection Coordination Review:** Re-evaluate and optimize protection coordination schemes to ensure faster and selective fault clearing, minimizing the impact duration of sags.
    *   **System Reinforcement:** Consider strengthening the transmission lines (LINE10_11, LINE11_12) or adding redundant paths to improve system robustness against sags.
    *   **Load Management:** Implement demand-side management strategies to prevent sudden large load changes that could cause sags.
    *   **Rectifier Hardening:** Ensure the rectifier and its DC load are designed to withstand typical voltage sag events without damage or significant performance degradation.

### Possible Causes

1.  **Faults on Adjacent Lines or Buses:**
    *   **Short Circuits:** A fault (e.g., single-phase-to-ground, phase-to-phase, or three-phase) on LINE10_11, LINE11_12, or buses BUS10 or BUS12. Even transient faults can cause sags.
    *   **Ground Faults:** Especially common in systems with effectively grounded neutrals.

2.  **Sudden Connection of Large Inductive Loads:**
    *   **Motor Starting:** The sudden starting of large motors (e.g., in industrial facilities connected to BUS10 or BUS12) can draw high inrush currents, causing a momentary voltage drop.
    *   **Transformer Energization:** Energizing large transformers can also cause inrush currents and voltage sags.

3.  **Generator or Synchronous Compensator Issues:**
    *   **Loss of Generation:** A sudden loss of one of the generators (GEN1 at BUS2, GEN2 at BUS3) or a significant drop in their output can lead to system-wide voltage drops, which propagate to BUS 11.
    *   **Malfunction of Voltage Regulators:** Issues with the automatic voltage regulators (AVRs) of GEN1 or GEN2, or issues with synchronous compensators (SYNC_COMP1, SYNC_COMP2, SYNC_COMP3) could lead to insufficient reactive power support.

4.  **Equipment Failure or Malfunction:**
    *   **Transformer Tap Changer Malfunction:** Incorrect tap settings or failure of an on-load tap changer on a transformer connected to the affected area.
    *   **Capacitor Bank Switching:** Incorrect or untimely switching of capacitor banks designed for reactive power compensation.
    *   **Rectifier Internal Fault:** While less likely to *cause* a sag on the AC side, an internal fault within the rectifier could potentially draw excessive current, leading to a localized sag if protection is slow.

5.  **External Factors:**
    *   **Lightning Strikes:** Can cause momentary flashovers on overhead lines, leading to transient faults and subsequent voltage sags.
    *   **Environmental Factors:** High winds causing conductor clashing, or animal contact with equipment.

### Possible Damages in the Context of a Power System

A voltage sag, even of 20 ms duration, can have significant impacts, especially if it's deep or repetitive.

1.  **Damage to Sensitive Electronic Equipment:**
    *   **Rectifier Circuit (DIODE_BRIDGE, DC_LINK_CAP):** The sudden drop and subsequent recovery of voltage can stress the diodes, capacitors, and other components within the rectifier. If the sag is followed by an overvoltage transient during recovery, it can lead to insulation breakdown or component failure. Prolonged or frequent sags can reduce their lifespan.
    *   **DC Load:** The DC_LOAD connected to the rectifier will experience a momentary loss or reduction of its DC input voltage, potentially leading to malfunction, data corruption, or even damage for critical loads that require a stable supply (e.g., control systems, computers, medical equipment).
    *   **Control Systems:** Protection relays, SCADA RTUs, and other control equipment can malfunction, reset, or trip incorrectly due to voltage sags, leading to operational errors or false alarms.

2.  **Operational Disruptions and Production Losses:**
    *   **Tripping of Loads:** Motors (if any) and other industrial loads (LOAD4, LOAD5, LOAD7, LOAD9, LOAD10, LOAD12, LOAD13, LOAD14) across the system may trip offline due to undervoltage protection, causing production interruptions and significant economic losses.
    *   **Process Interruption:** Industrial processes (e.g., continuous manufacturing) that rely on stable power can be severely disrupted, leading to product spoilage, equipment damage from sudden stops, and lengthy restart procedures.
    *   **Loss of Synchronization:** For severe and prolonged sags, generators (GEN1, GEN2) or synchronous compensators (SYNC_COMP1, SYNC_COMP2, SYNC_COMP3) might lose synchronism with the grid, potentially leading to cascade tripping and widespread outages.

3.  **Degradation of Equipment Lifespan:**
    *   **Transformers and Inductors:** Repeated voltage sags and subsequent recovery transients can cause mechanical stress on transformer windings due to electromagnetic forces, accelerating insulation degradation.
    *   **Motors:** Motors attempting to ride through sags may draw excessive current, leading to overheating and premature winding insulation failure.

4.  **System Instability:**
    *   If the sag is not quickly cleared or if it triggers multiple load trips, it can lead to a chain reaction, affecting voltage stability across the entire system. This could potentially lead to a partial or total system blackout.

### IEEE References and Nominal Ranges

1.  **Voltage Sag Definition:**
    *   **IEEE Standard 1159-2019 - IEEE Recommended Practice for Monitoring Electric Power Quality:** Defines a voltage sag (or dip) as a decrease in RMS voltage or current at the power frequency for durations from 0.5 cycles to 1 minute, to between 0.1 and 0.9 p.u.
