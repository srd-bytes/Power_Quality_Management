### Recommendations

1.  **Immediate Monitoring and Analysis:**
    *   Continuously monitor voltage (VM11) and current (IM11) at BUS 11.
    *   Analyze the depth and duration of the voltage sag using data from relevant measurement points (e.g., VM11).
    *   Check for any associated overcurrents on connected lines (LINE10_11, LINE11_12) that might indicate a fault elsewhere.
2.  **Protection System Review:**
    *   Verify that under-voltage protection relays at BUS 11 (and adjacent buses like BUS10, BUS12) are correctly configured and operating.
    *   Ensure that the rectifier connected to BUS 11 has appropriate sag ride-through capabilities or protection mechanisms to prevent damage to its components (DIODE_BRIDGE, DC_LINK_CAP) and the DC load.
3.  **Fault Localization and Isolation:**
    *   If the sag persists or recurs, investigate upstream and downstream components (LINE10_11, LINE11_12, BUS10, BUS12) for potential short circuits or transient events.
    *   Consider temporary isolation of non-critical loads at BUS 11 if the sag is severe and impacting critical operations, though a 20ms duration is typically transient.
4.  **Mitigation Strategies for Future Sags:**
    *   **Dynamic Voltage Restorers (DVRs):** Consider installing DVRs or other custom power devices at BUS 11 or critical loads connected to it, especially given the presence of a rectifier and its sensitive DC load.
    *   **Energy Storage Systems (ESS):** Implement UPS systems or battery storage for critical DC loads fed by the rectifier at BUS 11 to provide momentary power during sags.
    *   **Voltage Regulators/Compensators:** Evaluate the need for Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOMs) or Static Var Compensators (SVCs) in the vicinity if sags are frequent and widespread. (The system has SYNC_COMP1, SYNC_COMP2, SYNC_COMP3 at BUS3, BUS5, BUS6 respectively, their impact on BUS11 might be limited depending on system impedance).
    *   **Improved Grounding:** Ensure proper grounding practices are in place across the system, especially for equipment connected to BUS 11.
    *   **Maintenance and Inspection:** Regularly inspect insulation, overhead lines, and underground cables connected to BUS 11 for signs of degradation.

### Possible Causes

Voltage sags are primarily caused by short-circuit faults in the power system, but can also result from other events. Given the location at BUS 11 and its connections:

1.  **Short-Circuit Faults:**
    *   **Line-to-Ground Faults:** The most common type of fault, occurring on LINE10_11, LINE11_12, or connected distribution feeders.
    *   **Line-to-Line Faults:** Short circuits between two phases.
    *   **Three-Phase Faults:** While less common, these cause the most severe voltage sags.
    *   **Faults on adjacent buses:** A fault on BUS10 or BUS12, or further upstream/downstream, can propagate as a voltage sag to BUS 11.
2.  **Motor Starting:**
    *   Starting of large induction motors or other highly inductive loads in the vicinity of BUS 11 (or on connected buses like BUS12, BUS10) can draw significant inrush current, causing a temporary voltage drop.
3.  **Transformer Energization:**
    *   Energizing large transformers connected near BUS 11 can cause transient inrush currents leading to sags.
4.  **Switching Operations:**
    *   Switching of capacitor banks, lines, or other equipment in the network can cause momentary voltage changes.
5.  **Lightning Strikes:**
    *   Direct or indirect lightning strikes can initiate flashovers and short-circuit faults, leading to sags.
6.  **Equipment Failure:**
    *   Malfunction or failure of equipment such as insulators, cables, or circuit breakers connected to BUS 11 or nearby.
7.  **Heavy Loading Conditions:**
    *   Sudden increases in load demand, especially reactive power, can lead to voltage drops, though typically less severe than fault-induced sags.

### Possible Damages

Voltage sags, even brief ones, can have significant impacts on power system components and connected loads, particularly sensitive electronic equipment like the rectifier at BUS 11.

1.  **Rectifier and DC Load (at BUS 11):**
    *   **Malfunction/Tripping:** The DIODE_BRIDGE or associated control circuitry of the rectifier may malfunction or trip due to insufficient AC input voltage, leading to interruption of the DC power supply.
    *   **Reduced DC Output:** The DC_LINK_CAP voltage will drop, and the DC_LOAD will experience a reduced or interrupted power supply, potentially causing operational issues or data loss for critical equipment.
    *   **Component Stress/Damage:** Repeated sags or sags below the rectifier's ride-through capability can stress power electronic components (diodes, capacitors), potentially leading to premature failure.
2.  **Sensitive Electronic Equipment:**
    *   **Maloperation/Data Loss:** Computers, PLCs, control systems, and communication equipment (which may be part of the DC_LOAD) can malfunction, reset, or lose data.
    *   **Process Interruption:** Industrial processes relying on continuous and stable power can be interrupted, leading to significant production losses.
3.  **Motors and Drives:**
    *   **Reduced Torque:** Motors connected to the system may experience reduced torque, potentially leading to stalling or overheating if the sag is prolonged.
    *   **Nuisance Tripping:** Motor protection relays may trip unnecessarily, leading to downtime.
    *   **Damage to Drives:** Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) can trip or sustain damage to their internal power electronics.
4.  **Protection Systems:**
    *   **Misoperation:** Under-voltage relays might trip non-critically, causing unnecessary outages, or fail to operate correctly if the sag characteristics are unusual.
5.  **Lighting and HVAC Systems:**
    *   **Flicker/Dimming:** Lighting systems can flicker or dim, causing discomfort and potential safety hazards.
    *   **HVAC Interruption:** HVAC systems can trip, impacting environmental control.
6.  **Reduced Equipment Lifespan:**
    *   Repeated stress from voltage sags can degrade insulation and shorten the lifespan of various electrical equipment throughout the power system.

### IEEE References and Nominal Ranges

**IEEE References:**

*   **IEEE Std 1159-2019**: "IEEE Recommended Practice for Monitoring Electric Power Quality." This standard provides definitions for various power quality phenomena, including voltage sags, swells, and interruptions. It is the primary reference for characterizing voltage sags.
*   **IEEE Std 1668-2017**: "IEEE Recommended Practice for Characterizing Voltage Sags at Equipment Terminals." This standard focuses on the characterization of voltage sags specifically for evaluating equipment immunity.
*   **IEEE Std 1346-1998**: "IEEE Recommended Practice for Evaluating Electric Power System Compatibility with Electronic Process Equipment." This standard addresses the compatibility of industrial and commercial electronic equipment with the power system, including tolerance to voltage sags.

**Nominal Ranges for Voltage Sags (based on IEEE Std 1159):**

*   **Voltage Sag Definition:** A decrease in RMS voltage or current at the power frequency for durations from 0.5 cycles to 1 minute, to between 0.1 and 0.9 pu (per unit) of the nominal voltage.
    *   **Nominal Voltage (1.0 pu):** This refers to the declared or nameplate voltage of the system (e.g., 13.8 kV, 69 kV, 115 kV, etc., depending on the specific voltage level of BUS 11 in the `Simulink_14Bus_System`).
    *   **Sag Magnitude:** The voltage during a sag is typically between 10% and 90% of the nominal voltage.
    *   **Duration:** The duration of a sag is typically from 0.5 cycles (e.g., 8.3 ms for a 60 Hz system) up to 1 minute.
        *   The reported duration of 20 ms falls within the typical range for transient sags.

**General Power Quality Voltage Ranges (for comparison):**

*   **Steady-State Voltage:** For most utility systems, the steady-state voltage is expected to remain within ±5% to ±10% of the nominal voltage, as per various utility standards and regulatory requirements. Variations outside this range, if lasting longer than a few cycles, are typically classified as sags or swells.
