# Fault Analysis Report

## Fault Details
**Time:** 2025-12-15_11-24-12
**Type:** Voltage sag
**Location:** BUS 11
**Status:** ongoing
**Duration:** 20 ms

A voltage sag, characterized by a decrease in RMS voltage, has been detected at BUS 11 in the Simulink_14Bus_System. This bus is a critical point as it serves as the AC input for a rectifier system (`DIODE_BRIDGE`, `DC_LINK_CAP`, `DC_LOAD`). BUS 11 is interconnected with BUS 10 via LINE10_11 and with BUS 12 via LINE11_12. The short duration of 20 ms indicates a momentary event.

## Possible Causes

Voltage sags are primarily caused by sudden increases in load current or short-circuit faults in the power system. For a voltage sag at BUS 11, the potential causes include:

1.  **Short-Circuit Faults:**
    *   A fault (e.g., single-line-to-ground, line-to-line, or three-phase) occurring on the transmission lines connected to BUS 11 (LINE10_11, LINE11_12) or directly at BUS 11 itself.
    *   A fault on a feeder or a bus electrically close to BUS 11 (e.g., BUS 10 or BUS 12).
    *   A fault on the AC side of the rectifier system connected to BUS 11.
2.  **Sudden Load Changes:**
    *   Connection of a large inductive load or motor starting events on BUS 11 or adjacent buses (BUS 10, BUS 12), leading to a sudden demand for reactive power.
    *   A sudden increase in the DC load connected to the rectifier, drawing more current from BUS 11.
3.  **Transformer Inrush Current:**
    *   Energization of a large transformer connected to BUS 11 or nearby buses, drawing high magnetizing current that temporarily depresses voltage.
4.  **Capacitor Bank Switching:**
    *   Switching off a capacitor bank that was providing reactive power support to BUS 11 or nearby buses, leading to a sudden voltage drop.
5.  **Grid Disturbances:**
    *   Faults or disturbances originating from the upstream grid (e.g., near BUS1, BUS2, BUS3) that propagate through the system and affect the voltage profile at BUS 11.
6.  **Equipment Failure:**
    *   Malfunction of voltage regulation equipment (e.g., tap changers on transformers, SVCs/STATCOMs if present nearby) that are designed to maintain voltage levels.

## Possible Damages

Even a short-duration voltage sag can significantly impact sensitive equipment and overall system stability, particularly at BUS 11, which supplies a rectifier system and leads to downstream loads.

1.  **Rectifier System (DIODE_BRIDGE, DC_LINK_CAP, DC_LOAD):**
    *   **Maloperation/Tripping:** The `DIODE_BRIDGE` requires a stable AC input voltage for proper commutation. A sag can cause the output DC voltage to drop significantly, leading to maloperation, misfiring, or tripping of the rectifier.
    *   **Reduced DC Output:** The `DC_LINK_CAP` will discharge, and the DC output voltage supplied to the `DC_LOAD` will decrease. This can lead to under-voltage conditions for the DC load, potentially causing it to malfunction or shut down.
    *   **Component Stress:** Repeated or severe sags can stress the semiconductor devices (diodes) in the `DIODE_BRIDGE` due to improper current distribution or overcurrents during recovery, potentially leading to premature failure.
2.  **Downstream AC Loads (LOAD12, LOAD13, LOAD14):**
    *   **Malfunction of Sensitive Equipment:** Electronic equipment, control systems, and computers connected to BUS 12, BUS 13, and BUS 14 (which are downstream from BUS 11) are highly susceptible to voltage sags. They might reset, trip, or operate erratically, causing data loss or process interruptions.
    *   **Motor Stalling/Damage:** Induction motors connected to these buses could experience a reduction in torque, potentially leading to stalling. Upon voltage recovery, they might draw excessive inrush current, causing overheating, winding damage, or reduced lifespan.
    *   **Production Losses:** In industrial applications, maloperation or tripping of equipment due to sags can result in significant production losses and increased downtime.
3.  **Protection System Misoperation:**
    *   While a 20 ms sag is short, highly sensitive under-voltage protective relays could potentially misoperate, leading to unnecessary disconnections of healthy sections.
4.  **System Instability:**
    *   A severe or widespread sag can propagate through the system, affecting other buses and potentially leading to voltage instability or, in extreme cases, a cascading failure if not properly mitigated.

## Recommendations

Given the ongoing voltage sag at BUS 11, both immediate and long-term actions are crucial to mitigate its impact and prevent recurrence.

### Immediate Actions (for ongoing sag):

1.  **Isolate Fault (if applicable):** If the sag is due to a short-circuit fault, ensure the protection system promptly isolates the faulted section (e.g., LINE10_11, LINE11_12, or the rectifier AC input) to prevent further damage and restore voltage to healthy parts of the system. Monitor `IM11` for fault current and `VM11` for voltage drop depth.
2.  **Check Rectifier Status:** Verify the operational status of the rectifier connected to BUS 11. If it has tripped, investigate the cause thoroughly before attempting to restart.
3.  **System Monitoring:** Continuously monitor voltage (`VM11`) and current (`IM11`) at BUS 11, as well as adjacent buses (`VM10`, `VM12`, `IM10`, `IM12`) to assess the sag's extent, duration, and potential propagation.
4.  **Load Shedding (if necessary):** If the sag is severe and threatening overall system stability, consider temporary load shedding on downstream buses (BUS 12, BUS 13, BUS 14) to alleviate stress and support voltage recovery.

### Long-Term Recommendations:

1.  **Fault Location and Analysis:**
    *   Perform a detailed post-event analysis using fault recorders and SCADA data (measurements `VM11`, `IM11`, etc.) to precisely locate the fault source and determine its nature (e.g., type of fault, impedance).
    *   Investigate the operational history and maintenance records of components around BUS 11, including LINE10_11, LINE11_12, and the rectifier.
2.  **Improve Voltage Sag Ride-Through Capability:**
    *   **Rectifier Enhancement:** For the rectifier, consider implementing voltage sag ride-through features such as energy storage (e.g., larger `DC_LINK_CAP` or battery backup on the DC side) or fast-acting voltage support on the AC side to ensure continuous operation during short sags.
    *   **Sensitive Load Protection:** Install uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), voltage regulators, or dynamic voltage restorers (DVRs) for critical loads at BUS 12, BUS 13, and BUS 14 to provide immunity against future voltage sags.
3.  **Upgrade Protection and Control:**
    *   Review and optimize relay settings for overcurrent and under-voltage protection in the vicinity of BUS 11 to ensure proper coordination and fast fault clearance.
    *   Implement faster fault detection and isolation schemes to minimize sag duration.
4.  **System Reinforcement:**
    *   **Increase Fault Level:** If sags are primarily due to faults, increasing the fault level of the system (e.g., by adding more generation or reinforcing lines) can reduce the voltage drop during faults.
    *   **Reactive Power Support:** Install static VAR compensators (SVCs) or STATCOMs (similar to `SYNC_COMP1`, `SYNC_COMP2`, `SYNC_COMP3` but strategically located closer to BUS 11) to provide dynamic reactive power support and improve voltage stability during disturbances.
    *   **Redundancy:** Evaluate the possibility of adding redundant feeders to BUS 11 to provide alternative power paths in case of a fault on a primary line.
5.  **Preventive Maintenance:**
    *   Regularly inspect and maintain overhead lines, underground cables, transformers, and switchgear connected to BUS 11 to reduce the likelihood of insulation failures and equipment malfunctions.

## IEEE References and Nominal Ranges

**Voltage Sag Definition:**
According to **IEEE Std 1159-2019, *IEEE Recommended Practice for Monitoring Electric Power Quality***, a voltage sag (or dip) is defined as a decrease in RMS voltage or current at the power frequency for durations from 0.5 cycles to 1 minute, to between 0.1 and 0.9 pu (per unit) of the nominal voltage. The given duration of 20 ms falls within this definition (approximately 1 cycle at 50 Hz or 1.2 cycles at 60 Hz).

**Nominal Voltage Ranges:**
*   **Steady-State Voltage:** For typical power systems, steady-state voltage is expected to remain within certain tolerances. **IEEE Std 1346-1998 (*IEEE Recommended Practice for Evaluating Electric Power System Compatibility with Electronic Process Equipment and Electric Utilization Equipment*)** and **IEEE Std 1250-1995 (*IEEE Guide for Service to Equipment Sensitive to Momentary Voltage Disturbances*)** (both superseded by **IEEE Std 1668-2017**) suggest that voltages typically remain within ±5% of the nominal voltage for normal operation. Some distribution systems may tolerate up to ±10%.
*   **Voltage Sag Threshold:** A sag occurs when the voltage drops below 90% (0.9 pu) of the nominal voltage. The severity of the sag is determined by its depth (how low the voltage drops) and its duration.
*   **IEEE Std 1668-2017, *IEEE Recommended Practice for the Application of Voltage Sag and Interruption Ride-Through Requirements for Utility and End-Use Equipment***, provides specific guidance on designing equipment to ride through various voltage sag conditions.
*   **IEEE Std 1547, *Standard for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems***, also includes requirements for distributed energy resources to remain connected and provide support during certain voltage disturbances, which can contribute to sag mitigation.

The specific nominal voltage for BUS 11 is dependent on the base voltage of the `Simulink_14Bus_System`. For instance, if the nominal voltage is 1.0 pu (e.g., 13.8 kV), a sag would mean the voltage dropped below 12.42 kV (0.9 pu).
