**Recommendations:**

1.  **Protection System Review:**
    *   Verify the settings and operational integrity of overvoltage protection relays associated with BUS8 and any connected equipment. Ensure trip settings are appropriate for the system's nominal voltage and expected transient conditions, adhering to IEEE Std C37.102™ (Guide for AC Generator Ground Protection) and IEEE Std C37.90™ (Standard for Relays and Relay Systems Associated with Electric Power Apparatus).
    *   Consider implementing adaptive protection schemes if voltage swells are a recurring issue.

2.  **Root Cause Analysis:**
    *   Conduct a detailed investigation to identify the specific event or condition that triggered the voltage swell at BUS8. This may involve analyzing system logs, SCADA data, and fault recorder data from the time of the event.
    *   Examine the operational status of adjacent lines and equipment (e.g., generator output from GEN1/GEN2, load changes at BUS7/BUS9, or capacitor bank switching events if any are present in the wider system) that could influence voltage at BUS8.

3.  **Power Quality Monitoring Enhancement:**
    *   Leverage existing measurement points (`VM8`, `IM8`) and consider deploying higher-resolution power quality monitors at BUS8 to capture detailed waveform data (magnitude, duration, phase angle changes) during future events. This data is crucial for accurate diagnosis and compliance verification with IEEE Std 1159™ (Recommended Practice for Monitoring Electric Power Quality).

4.  **Equipment Hardening:**
    *   For critical loads or sensitive electronic equipment potentially connected to BUS8 (though not explicitly listed in the provided JSON, it's a general power system consideration), evaluate the installation of surge protective devices (SPDs) or voltage regulators to mitigate the impact of future swells. Ensure SPDs comply with IEEE Std C62.41.2™ (Recommended Practice for Characterization of Surges in Low-Voltage AC Power Circuits).

5.  **Operational Procedures Review:**
    *   Review switching procedures for capacitor banks, large loads, and other reactive power compensation devices in the vicinity of BUS8 to minimize the likelihood of inducing voltage swells.

**Possible Causes:**

A voltage swell is typically defined by IEEE Std 1159™ as an increase in RMS voltage or current at the power frequency for durations from 0.5 cycles to 1 minute, with magnitudes between 1.1 pu and 1.8 pu (110% to 180% of nominal voltage).

Possible causes for a voltage swell at BUS8 could include:

*   **Load Shedding:** Sudden disconnection of a large load (e.g., LOAD7 at BUS7 or LOAD9 at BUS9, if connected via unlisted lines to BUS8, or other large loads upstream) can cause the system voltage to rise temporarily due to reduced current draw and reactive power demand.
*   **Capacitor Bank Switching:** The energization of a large shunt capacitor bank (if present in the system, even if not explicitly listed near BUS8) injects reactive power into the system, which can lead to a temporary voltage increase, especially on lightly loaded feeders.
*   **Single-Phase Faults on Unfaulted Phases:** A single line-to-ground fault on one phase of a three-phase system can cause voltage swells on the unfaulted phases due to system imbalance and potential ground potential rise.
*   **Transformer Tap Changes:** Malfunctioning or incorrect operation of on-load tap changers (OLTCs) on transformers could lead to an overvoltage condition if the tap setting is too high.
*   **Lightly Loaded Lines (Ferranti Effect):** During light load conditions, especially on long transmission lines, the capacitive charging current can cause the voltage at the receiving end (or an intermediate bus like BUS8) to be higher than at the sending end.
*   **Fault Clearing:** The sudden removal of a fault condition by protective devices can sometimes lead to a temporary voltage rise as the system stabilizes and reactive power flows adjust.
*   **Generator Overexcitation:** A generator (e.g., GEN1 at BUS2, GEN2 at BUS3) operating with excessive excitation can contribute to system overvoltage.

**Possible Damages:**

Voltage swells, even of short duration like 39 ms, can have detrimental effects on power system equipment, particularly if they are frequent or of high magnitude. The nominal voltage range for power systems typically allows for variations of ±5% to ±10% (e.g., 0.9 pu to 1.1 pu) under normal operating conditions, as per IEEE Std 1250™ (Guide for Service to Equipment Sensitive to Momentary Voltage Disturbances). A swell exceeding these limits can cause:

*   **Insulation Degradation and Failure:** Repeated or severe overvoltages stress the dielectric insulation of cables, transformers, motors, and other electrical apparatus. This accelerates insulation aging, leading to premature breakdown and equipment failure.
*   **Damage to Electronic Equipment:** Sensitive electronic devices, control systems, and power electronics (such as the DIODE_BRIDGE and DC_LINK_CAP in the rectifier at BUS11, if affected by the swell propagating through the system) are highly vulnerable to overvoltage. This can cause immediate component failure, reduced lifespan, or erratic operation.
*   **Capacitor and Surge Arrester Overstress:** Shunt capacitors can be overstressed by voltages exceeding their ratings, leading to dielectric breakdown and failure. Surge arresters might operate unnecessarily, reducing their lifespan, or even be damaged if the swell magnitude exceeds their energy absorption capabilities.
*   **Motor and Generator Overexcitation:** Prolonged overvoltage can cause excessive magnetic flux in the cores of motors and generators (like GEN1, GEN2), leading to saturation, increased iron losses, overheating, and potential damage to windings.
*   **Lighting and Appliance Failure:** Overvoltage can cause incandescent light bulbs to burn out quickly and damage other voltage-sensitive household and industrial appliances.
*   **Rectifier Component Failure:** The rectifier system connected to BUS11 could experience damage to its diodes and DC link capacitors if a voltage swell propagates to it, leading to increased conduction losses, reverse breakdown, or capacitor rupture.
