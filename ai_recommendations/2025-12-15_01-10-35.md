### Recommendations

1.  **Immediate Monitoring and Verification:**
    *   Utilize the `VM11` measurement to confirm the sag's magnitude and exact duration.
    *   Check `IM11` for any abnormal current fluctuations that might indicate an upstream fault or a sudden change in load on BUS 11.
    *   Monitor the status of the rectifier connected to BUS 11, specifically its DC output and the health of its components (`DIODE_BRIDGE`, `DC_LINK_CAP`, `DC_LOAD`).

2.  **Root Cause Analysis:**
    *   Investigate the operational status of adjacent lines, specifically `LINE10_11` and `LINE11_12`, for any recorded faults or switching events.
    *   Review the operational logs for `LOAD12` (connected to BUS 12, adjacent to BUS 11) and `LOAD10` (connected to BUS 10, adjacent to BUS 11) for sudden load changes or motor starts.
    *   Examine protection relay records from BUS 10 and BUS 12 for any tripping events.

3.  **Protection System Review:**
    *   Verify the settings of undervoltage relays on BUS 11 and connected equipment (especially the rectifier) to ensure proper coordination and prevent nuisance tripping for short-duration sags.
    *   Ensure that critical loads and the rectifier have appropriate ride-through capabilities or backup power/voltage support systems.

4.  **Mitigation Strategies for Future Sags:**
    *   **Voltage Support Devices:** Consider installing voltage support equipment such as STATCOMs, SVCs, or capacitor banks if sags are frequent or severe at BUS 11 or nearby buses.
    *   **Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS):** For sensitive loads connected to BUS 11 (e.g., the DC load fed by the rectifier), ensure adequate UPS systems are in place.
    *   **Fault Current Limiters:** Investigate the possibility of fault current limiters on upstream feeders to reduce the severity of fault-induced sags.
    *   **Grid Hardening:** Explore measures to improve the reliability of lines connected to BUS 11 (`LINE10_11`, `LINE11_12`) to minimize upstream faults.

### Possible Causes

Given the location at BUS 11 and its connection to the rectifier:

1.  **Upstream Short Circuit Faults:**
    *   A fault (e.g., single-phase-to-ground, phase-to-phase, three-phase) on `LINE10_11` or `LINE11_12`.
    *   A fault on an adjacent bus like `BUS10` or `BUS12`.
    *   Faults on other parts of the system (e.g., `LINE9_10`, `LINE12_13`) that are electrically close to BUS 11, especially if the system impedance is high.
2.  **Sudden Connection of Large Loads:**
    *   The energizing of a large motor or transformer (inrush current) on `BUS10`, `BUS12`, or another nearby bus.
    *   A sudden increase in `LOAD12` or `LOAD10` demand, though typically a sag is more pronounced with inductive loads or faults.
3.  **Generator Tripping/Loss:**
    *   The loss of a significant generation source (`GEN1` at `BUS2` or `GEN2` at `BUS3`) could lead to a system-wide voltage drop, which might manifest as a sag at BUS 11, depending on the system's reactive power support.
4.  **Capacitor Bank Switching:**
    *   Incorrectly timed or faulty switching of capacitor banks on adjacent buses can cause transient voltage sags or swells.
5.  **Lightning Strikes:**
    *   A lightning strike causing a momentary fault on a transmission line or equipment near BUS 11 could result in a short-duration voltage sag before protection clears the fault.
6.  **Rectifier-Related Issues:**
    *   While less common for sags, a severe internal fault within the `DIODE_BRIDGE` or `DC_LOAD` of the rectifier, if not properly isolated, could draw excessive current and momentarily depress the AC voltage on BUS 11.

### Possible Damages

A voltage sag, even short in duration (20 ms), can have significant impacts, especially on sensitive equipment and the rectifier system at BUS 11:

1.  **Damage to Sensitive Electronic Equipment:**
    *   **Malfunction/Tripping:** Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs), computers, communication systems, and medical equipment can malfunction or trip offline, leading to process interruptions.
    *   **Data Loss:** Unsaved data in control systems or computers can be lost.
    *   **Permanent Damage:** While less likely for a 20 ms sag unless very deep, repeated sags or sags combined with other disturbances can reduce the lifespan or cause permanent damage to electronic components.
2.  **Impact on Motors and Drives:**
    *   **Stalling/Tripping:** Motors, especially large industrial motors, can experience a reduction in torque, potentially leading to stalling or tripping of undervoltage protection.
    *   **Overheating:** If motors attempt to ride through the sag, increased current draw can lead to overheating and reduced insulation life.
3.  **Rectifier System at BUS 11:**
    *   **DC Output Reduction:** The primary impact will be a drop in the DC voltage output of the rectifier, directly affecting the `DC_LOAD`.
    *   **Malfunction/Tripping of Rectifier:** The `DIODE_BRIDGE` or associated control circuitry might malfunction or trip due to undervoltage conditions.
    *   **Stress on DC-Link Capacitor (`DC_LINK_CAP`):** The capacitor will discharge to maintain the DC voltage, and the sudden recharge upon voltage recovery can stress the component, reducing its lifespan.
    *   **Damage to `DC_LOAD`:** Depending on the sensitivity of the `DC_LOAD`, a sag in its supply voltage could cause malfunction or damage.
4.  **Protection System Maloperation:**
    *   **Nuisance Tripping:** Overly sensitive undervoltage relays might unnecessarily trip circuit breakers, leading to extended outages even after the sag has passed.
    *   **Failure to Trip:** In rare cases, complex interactions during a sag could affect the proper operation of protection systems.
5.  **Loss of Production and Economic Impact:**
    *   In industrial settings, a sag can cause production lines to halt, leading to significant financial losses due to downtime, wasted materials, and restart costs.
    *   Data centers or critical infrastructure relying on the rectifier's DC output could experience service interruptions.
6.  **System Instability:**
    *   If the sag is severe or widespread, or if multiple sags occur in quick succession, it could contribute to wider system instability, potentially leading to cascading failures or blackouts.

### IEEE References and Nominal Ranges

1.  **IEEE Standard 1159-2019 - Recommended Practice for Monitoring Electric Power Quality:**
    *   **Definition:** Defines a voltage sag (or dip) as a decrease in the RMS AC voltage at the power frequency for durations from 0.5 cycles to 1 minute. The voltage magnitude is typically between 0.1 pu and 0.9 pu (10% to 90% of nominal voltage).
    *   **Context:** The reported fault is a "Voltage sag" with a duration of 20 ms. For a 60 Hz system, 20 ms is 1.2 cycles (20 ms / (1/60 Hz * 1000 ms/s)). For a 50 Hz system, 20 ms is 1 cycle. This duration falls well within the IEEE 1159 definition of a sag.

2.  **IEEE Standard 1346-1998 - Recommended Practice for Evaluating Electric Power System Compatibility with Electronic Process Equipment:**
    *   Provides guidance on the compatibility of electronic equipment with power system disturbances, including voltage sags.

3.  **IEEE Standard 519-2014 - Recommended Practice and Requirements for Harmonic Control in Electric Power Systems:**
    *   While primarily focused on harmonics, it underscores the importance of maintaining power quality for the proper operation of sensitive equipment, including rectifiers.

**Nominal Voltage Ranges (General Industry Practice):**

*   **Steady-State Operation:** For most power systems, the voltage is expected to remain within a range of **±5%** of the nominal voltage (i.e., between 0.95 pu and 1.05 pu). Some utilities allow for wider ranges like ±7% or even ±10% in certain areas.
*   **Voltage Sag Threshold:** A voltage sag occurs when the RMS voltage drops below this nominal operating range, typically considered below **0.9 pu** (90% of nominal voltage).
*   **Ride-Through Capability:** Modern equipment, especially industrial controls and IT equipment, is often designed to "ride through" short-duration sags. The **ITIC (Information Technology Industry Council) Curve** is a widely recognized standard illustrating the voltage ride-through capability of typical information technology equipment. For a 20 ms duration, IT equipment often can tolerate voltage levels significantly below 0.9 pu (e.g., down to 0.5 pu or even lower, depending on the specific equipment and manufacturer specifications) without interruption. However, very deep sags can still cause issues.
