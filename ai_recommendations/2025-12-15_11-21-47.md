## Fault Details

**Time:** 2025-12-15_11-21-47
**Type:** Voltage sag
**Location:** BUS 11
**Status:** ongoing
**Duration:** 20 ms

## Recommendations

Given the voltage sag at BUS 11, which serves as the AC input for a rectifier, the following recommendations are provided:

### Immediate Actions
1.  **Verify Measurements:** Confirm the sag magnitude and exact duration using real-time measurements from VM11 and other relevant points in the system.
2.  **Check Protection Systems:** Investigate the operation of protective relays and circuit breakers on lines connected to BUS 11 (LINE10_11, LINE11_12) and adjacent buses (BUS10, BUS12) to ensure proper fault clearing, if the sag was fault-initiated.
3.  **Inspect Rectifier & DC Load:** Immediately inspect the rectifier components (DIODE_BRIDGE, DC_LINK_CAP) and the connected DC_LOAD for any signs of malfunction, tripping, or damage. Ensure the DC load is stable or has tripped safely.
4.  **System Stability Check:** Monitor overall system voltage and frequency stability, especially at generator buses (BUS2, BUS3) and other critical load buses.

### Analysis and Mitigation
1.  **Root Cause Analysis:** Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the exact cause of the voltage sag. This may involve analyzing fault recorder data, sequence of events records, and historical data.
2.  **Voltage Support Devices:** Consider implementing voltage support solutions such as Static VAR Compensators (SVC), STATCOMs, or Dynamic Voltage Restorers (DVR) near BUS 11 or other critical buses to improve voltage stability and ride-through capability during sags.
3.  **Protection System Review:** Review and potentially adjust protection settings on lines and equipment connected to BUS 11 to ensure faster and more selective fault clearing, which can minimize sag duration and severity.
4.  **Equipment Ride-Through:** For critical loads supplied by the rectifier, evaluate and enhance their sag ride-through capability (e.g., by adding UPS systems, energy storage, or sag-tolerant control systems).
5.  **Enhanced Monitoring:** Deploy more granular power quality monitoring equipment at BUS 11 and adjacent buses to capture detailed sag characteristics (magnitude, duration, phase angle jump) for better analysis and future prevention.

### Maintenance
1.  **Infrastructure Inspection:** Regularly inspect transmission lines (LINE10_11, LINE11_12), transformers, and switchgear connected to BUS 11 and its vicinity for any signs of degradation, insulation issues, or loose connections that could lead to faults.
2.  **Rectifier Maintenance:** Implement a robust preventive maintenance schedule for the rectifier, including checking components like diodes, capacitors, and control circuitry, to ensure its robustness against power quality disturbances.

## Possible Causes

Voltage sags are typically caused by sudden increases in current flow or short-circuit faults within the power system. For a sag at BUS 11, possible causes include:

1.  **Short-Circuit Faults:**
    *   **On adjacent lines:** A temporary single-phase, phase-to-phase, or three-phase fault on LINE10_11 (connecting BUS10 to BUS11) or LINE11_12 (connecting BUS11 to BUS12).
    *   **On adjacent buses:** A fault on BUS10 or BUS12, which are electrically close to BUS 11.
    *   **On other parts of the system:** A fault elsewhere in the `Simulink_14Bus_System` that is severe enough to propagate a voltage depression to BUS 11.
2.  **Starting of Large Motors:** The inrush current drawn by large inductive loads (e.g., if a large motor connected to LOAD10 or LOAD12 were to start) can cause a momentary voltage drop.
3.  **Transformer Energization:** Energizing a large transformer (not explicitly detailed in the JSON but could be present in substations) can cause a significant inrush current and a temporary voltage sag.
4.  **Switching Operations:** Sudden switching of large capacitor banks or reactors, though less common for severe sags, can cause voltage fluctuations.
5.  **Lightning Strikes:** A direct or indirect lightning strike can cause a momentary flashover, leading to a temporary fault and subsequent voltage sag.
6.  **Equipment Malfunction:**
    *   Failure of a circuit breaker to clear a fault quickly.
    *   Malfunction of voltage regulators or tap changers.
    *   Sudden loss of a generator (GEN1, GEN2) or synchronous compensator (SYNC_COMP1, SYNC_COMP2, SYNC_COMP3), leading to a system-wide voltage depression.
7.  **Overload Conditions:** While 20ms is short for a sag due to overload, a sudden, severe overload on a connected line or bus could trigger a momentary voltage dip before protection acts.

## Possible Damages

A voltage sag, even for a short duration like 20 ms, can have significant impacts, especially on sensitive equipment like the rectifier and its connected DC load at BUS 11.

1.  **Rectifier and DC Load Damage/Malfunction:**
    *   **Tripping:** The rectifier (DIODE_BRIDGE) or its control system may trip offline to protect itself from undervoltage, leading to an interruption of the DC_LOAD.
    *   **Component Stress:** Repeated sags can stress semiconductor devices (diodes/thyristors) in the DIODE_BRIDGE, potentially leading to premature failure due to transient overcurrents during recovery or insufficient gate drive.
    *   **DC Link Capacitor (DC_LINK_CAP) Issues:** The capacitor might experience increased ripple current or discharge, affecting the stability of the DC voltage supplied to the DC_LOAD.
    *   **DC Load Disruption:** Any process or equipment relying on the DC_LOAD will experience disruption, data loss, or complete shutdown.
2.  **Sensitive Electronic Equipment:**
    *   **Control Systems:** Control systems for generators (GEN1, GEN2), synchronous compensators, and other critical infrastructure can malfunction, causing erroneous commands or tripping.
    *   **Computers/PLCs:** Computers, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), and other digital equipment throughout the system (especially at BUS 11 and adjacent buses) may reset, lose data, or experience operational errors.
3.  **Motor and Industrial Process Disruptions:**
    *   **Motor Tripping/Stalling:** Motors connected to loads (e.g., LOAD10, LOAD12) can experience a momentary loss of torque, potentially leading to tripping off-line or stalling, causing production downtime.
    *   **Process Interruption:** Industrial processes dependent on continuous operation of motors or other equipment can be severely disrupted, leading to product spoilage, equipment damage, and significant economic losses.
4.  **Equipment Degradation and Reduced Lifespan:**
    *   **Insulation Stress:** Voltage sags, especially if associated with transient overvoltages during recovery, can stress insulation in cables and transformers (e.g., LINE10_11, LINE11_12), accelerating degradation.
    *   **Contactors and Relays:** Electromechanical contactors and relays might chatter or drop out, leading to wear and tear.
5.  **System Instability:**
    *   **Voltage Instability:** If the sag is severe or prolonged, it can lead to further voltage depressions across the network, potentially causing a cascade of equipment tripping and widespread outages.
    *   **Power Quality Degradation:** Repeated sags contribute to overall power quality degradation, impacting the reliability and efficiency of the entire power system.

## IEEE References and Nominal Ranges

*   **Voltage Sag Definition:**
    *   **IEEE Std 1159-2019, "IEEE Recommended Practice for Monitoring Electric Power Quality,"** defines a voltage sag (or dip) as a decrease in RMS voltage or current at the power frequency for durations from 0.5 cycles to 1 minute, to between 0.1 and 0.9 per unit (pu) of the nominal voltage. The reported duration of 20 ms falls within this definition (approximately 1 cycle for a 50 Hz system, or 1.2 cycles for a 60 Hz system).
*   **Voltage Tolerance and Compatibility:**
    *   **IEEE Std 1346-1998, "IEEE Recommended Practice for Evaluating Electric Power System Compatibility with Electronic Process Equipment,"** provides guidelines for the voltage tolerance of various types of electronic equipment, illustrating their ride-through capabilities during sags.
    *   **IEEE Std 1668-2017, "IEEE Recommended Practice for the Characterization of Voltage Sags and Undervoltages,"** offers methods for characterizing voltage sags and undervoltages, including their magnitude, duration, and phase angle jump.
*   **Nominal Voltage Ranges:**
    *   In a typical power system analysis, the nominal operating voltage is considered **1.0 per unit (pu)**. A voltage sag implies a reduction below this nominal value.
    *   The range for a voltage sag is generally considered to be **0.1 pu to 0.9 pu** of the nominal RMS voltage. Voltages below 0.1 pu are typically classified as interruptions.
