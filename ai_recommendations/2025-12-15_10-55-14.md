### Recommendations

Given the ongoing voltage sag at BUS 11, which is the AC bus for a rectifier in the system, immediate and systematic actions are required to restore normal operation and prevent potential damage.

1.  **Immediate Actions:**
    *   **Verify Sag Severity:** Utilize measurements `VM11` and `IM11` to quantify the sag magnitude and duration. Check if any protective relays have operated or are close to operating.
    *   **Isolate if Necessary:** If the sag is severe (e.g., below 0.5 pu) and impacting critical loads or equipment, consider temporary isolation of non-essential loads connected to BUS 11 or downstream (e.g., `LOAD12`, `LOAD13`, `LOAD14`) to reduce stress on the system and the rectifier.
    *   **Check Rectifier Status:** Investigate the operational status of the rectifier connected to `BUS11`. Faulty operation or excessive load on its `DC_LOAD` could be contributing.

2.  **Investigation & Diagnosis:**
    *   **Upstream Analysis:** Analyze voltage and current measurements at `BUS10` (connected via `LINE10_11`) to determine if the sag originates upstream.
    *   **Downstream Analysis:** Check measurements at `BUS12` (connected via `LINE11_12`) to see if a fault or heavy load downstream is pulling down the voltage at BUS 11.
    *   **Load Analysis:** Review load profiles for `LOAD12`, `LOAD13`, `LOAD14`, and the `DC_LOAD` of the rectifier to identify any sudden, large load increases or motor starts.
    *   **Protection System Review:** Examine event logs of protective relays on `LINE10_11` and `LINE11_12` for any tripping events or alarms.
    *   **Harmonic Analysis:** Since a rectifier is present, check for increased harmonic distortion, which can sometimes accompany or exacerbate voltage sags if filters are compromised or the rectifier is misoperating.

3.  **Mitigation Strategies (for future prevention):**
    *   **Voltage Support Devices:** Consider installing voltage sag compensators such as Dynamic Voltage Restorers (DVRs) or Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOMs) at or near BUS 11 to provide rapid voltage support during sags.
    *   **Load Management:** Implement smarter load shedding schemes or demand-side management for large loads to prevent sudden voltage drops.
    *   **Grid Hardening:** Evaluate the strength of the transmission lines (`LINE10_11`, `LINE11_12`) and upstream grid components.
    *   **Rectifier Controls:** Optimize the control system of the rectifier to ensure it doesn't draw excessive reactive power or contribute to voltage instability during transient events.
    *   **Energy Storage:** Deploy battery energy storage systems (BESS) at strategic locations to provide momentary power and voltage support during sags.

### Possible Causes

Voltage sags at BUS 11 can arise from various factors within the power system:

1.  **Faults in the Power System:**
    *   **Upstream Faults:** A short circuit or ground fault on `LINE10_11`, `BUS10`, or any component further upstream (e.g., `LINE9_10`, `BUS9`, `GEN1`, `GEN2`). The fault current draw causes a temporary voltage drop across system impedances.
    *   **Downstream Faults:** A fault on `LINE11_12`, `BUS12`, or any lines/loads connected further downstream (e.g., `LOAD12`, `LOAD13`, `LOAD14`). Even though downstream, the fault current will be drawn through BUS 11, causing a sag.
    *   **Transformer Faults:** Faults within transformers connected to the relevant lines.

2.  **Sudden Increase in Load:**
    *   **Large Motor Starting:** Starting of large induction motors (not explicitly shown at BUS 11, but potentially at `LOAD12`, `LOAD13`, `LOAD14` or other unmodeled loads) can draw significant inrush current, causing a momentary voltage drop.
    *   **Switching on Heavy Loads:** Energizing substantial resistive or inductive loads.
    *   **Rectifier Load Increase:** A sudden increase in the `DC_LOAD` connected to the rectifier at `BUS11` could lead to increased AC current draw, potentially causing a voltage sag if the source impedance is high.

3.  **Transformer Energization (Inrush Current):**
    *   Energizing a large transformer in the vicinity of BUS 11 (e.g., if one of the lines connects to a transformer not detailed) can draw a large, short-duration magnetizing inrush current, leading to a sag.

4.  **Capacitor Bank Switching:**
    *   Switching OFF a shunt capacitor bank that was previously providing reactive power support can cause a voltage drop.

5.  **Generator or Synchronous Compensator Issues:**
    *   Loss of generation (e.g., `GEN1`, `GEN2`) or a significant reduction in reactive power support from synchronous compensators (`SYNC_COMP1`, `SYNC_COMP2`, `SYNC_COMP3`) can lead to widespread voltage drops, including at BUS 11.

6.  **Rectifier Malfunction:**
    *   A malfunction in the `DIODE_BRIDGE` or control system of the rectifier at `BUS11` could lead to excessive reactive power consumption or harmonic injection, contributing to or causing the voltage sag.

### Possible Damages

Voltage sags, especially if prolonged or frequent, can cause significant damage and operational issues in a power system and connected equipment:

1.  **Equipment Malfunction and Damage:**
    *   **Sensitive Electronics:** Computers, control systems, and other microprocessor-based equipment are highly susceptible to voltage sags, leading to resets, data corruption, or complete failure. This is particularly critical for the `rectifier` control systems.
    *   **Motors:** Induction motors can experience increased current draw, overheating, and reduced torque during sags, potentially leading to mechanical stress or insulation degradation. This can affect any motors within `LOAD12`, `LOAD13`, `LOAD14`.
    *   **Contactors and Relays:** Can drop out, leading to unintended tripping of equipment or processes, and potentially causing damage to their internal components.
    *   **Rectifier Components:** The `DIODE_BRIDGE`, `DC_LINK_CAP`, and the `DC_LOAD` connected to the rectifier at `BUS11` can be stressed. Prolonged sags can cause the rectifier to operate outside its design parameters, leading to component failure or reduced lifespan.

2.  **Process Interruption and Production Losses:**
    *   Industrial processes relying on continuous power can halt, leading to significant financial losses due to spoiled products, equipment downtime, and restart costs.
    *   Data centers (if any within `LOAD12`, `LOAD13`, `LOAD14`) can experience data loss and system crashes, even with UPS systems, if the sag exceeds the UPS ride-through capability or duration.

3.  **Reduced Equipment Lifespan:**
    *   Repeated exposure to voltage sags can stress electrical insulation, mechanical components (e.g., in switchgear), and semiconductor devices, leading to premature aging and failure.

4.  **Protection System Misoperation:**
    *   Some protective relays might misinterpret voltage sags as fault conditions, leading to nuisance tripping and unnecessary power outages. Conversely, some relays might fail to operate correctly if their auxiliary power supply is affected by the sag.

5.  **Grid Instability:**
    *   Severe or widespread voltage sags can lead to cascading failures, where the collapse of voltage in one area triggers further issues across the grid, potentially leading to a blackout.

### IEEE References and Nominal Ranges

1.  **Definition of Voltage Sag:**
    *   **IEEE Standard 1159-2019, *IEEE Recommended Practice for Monitoring Electric Power Quality***: Defines a voltage sag (or dip) as a decrease in the RMS value of the AC voltage or current at the power frequency for durations from 0.5 cycles to 1 minute, to between 0.1 and 0.9 pu (per unit) of the nominal voltage.
    *   **Nominal Range:** For a 1.0 pu nominal voltage, a sag would typically fall within **0.1 pu to 0.9 pu**.

2.  **Recommended Voltage Limits for Continuous Operation:**
    *   While IEEE 1159 defines sags, other standards provide guidelines for acceptable continuous voltage.
    *   **ANSI C84.1-2020, *American National Standard for Electric Power Systems and Equipment - Voltage Ratings (60 Hz)***: Specifies voltage ranges for electrical power systems and equipment. For nominal 120 V systems, Range A (preferred) is typically $\pm 5\%$ (0.95 pu to 1.05 pu), and Range B (tolerable) is $\pm 10\%$ (0.90 pu to 1.10 pu). Sags fall below these continuous operating ranges.
    *   **Nominal Operating Range (Typical):** **0.95 pu to 1.05 pu** (continuous operation). A voltage sag implies a deviation below 0.9 pu.

3.  **Power Quality Considerations:**
    *   **IEEE Standard 519-2014, *IEEE Recommended Practice and Requirements for Harmonic Control in Electric Power Systems***: While primarily focused on harmonics, it's relevant for systems with rectifiers. Excessive harmonic currents (which can be exacerbated during sags or by rectifier malfunction) can contribute to voltage distortion and heating, indirectly impacting voltage levels.
    *   **IEEE Standard 1346-1998, *IEEE Recommended Practice for Evaluating Electric Power System Compatibility With Electronic Process Equipment***: Provides guidance on how power quality phenomena, including voltage sags, affect sensitive electronic equipment.
