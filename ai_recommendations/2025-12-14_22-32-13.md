# Fault Report: Voltage Sag at BUS 11

**Time:** 2025-12-14_22-32-13
**Type:** Voltage sag
**Location:** BUS 11
**Status:** ongoing
**Duration:** ongoing

## Fault Details

A voltage sag has been detected at BUS 11 in the `Simulink_14Bus_System`. This is an ongoing event, indicating a sustained reduction in the RMS voltage magnitude at this bus. BUS 11 is a critical point in the system as it serves as the AC input for a rectifier, which converts AC power to DC for its connected DC load. It is also connected to transmission lines `LINE10_11` and `LINE11_12`.

## Recommendations

1.  **Immediate Monitoring and Verification:**
    *   Continuously monitor voltage (VM11) and current (IM11) at BUS 11.
    *   Check voltage levels at adjacent buses, specifically BUS 10 and BUS 12, to determine the extent and propagation of the sag.
    *   Verify the operational status of the rectifier connected to BUS 11 and its associated DC load.

2.  **Protection System Review:**
    *   Ensure that protective relays are correctly set to detect and isolate faults causing the sag without over-tripping due to transient conditions.
    *   Verify that under-voltage protection at BUS 11 and for the rectifier is functioning as intended.

3.  **Root Cause Analysis:**
    *   Investigate upstream components (e.g., `LINE10_11`, `BUS10`, `BUS9`, `GEN2`, `GEN1`) for potential short circuits, equipment failures, or sudden load changes.
    *   Analyze historical data from measurements at BUS 11 (VM11, IM11) and neighboring buses for patterns or preceding events.

4.  **Voltage Support and Mitigation:**
    *   If the sag is severe and persistent, consider activating voltage support mechanisms if available, such as capacitor banks (if present), or adjusting tap changers on nearby transformers (if present and controllable).
    *   For critical loads supplied by the rectifier, evaluate the need for uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) or dynamic voltage restorers (DVRs) to mitigate future sags.

5.  **Rectifier Health Check:**
    *   After the sag clears, perform a thorough inspection of the rectifier components (DIODE_BRIDGE, DC_LINK_CAP) for any signs of damage or degradation due to prolonged operation under sag conditions.

## Possible Causes

Voltage sags are typically caused by short circuits, but can also result from large load switching or energization events. Possible causes for a voltage sag at BUS 11 include:

*   **Short Circuits:**
    *   A fault (e.g., single-phase-to-ground, phase-to-phase, or three-phase) on `LINE10_11` or `LINE11_12`.
    *   A fault on an adjacent bus, such as BUS 10 or BUS 12.
    *   Faults on parallel feeders or upstream transmission lines that contribute power to BUS 11.
*   **Load Switching:**
    *   Starting of large inductive motors or switching of heavy loads (e.g., `LOAD12`, `LOAD13`, `LOAD14`) that draw significant inrush current, causing a temporary voltage drop.
    *   Energization of large transformers.
*   **Generation or Transmission Issues:**
    *   Loss of a major generation unit (e.g., `GEN1`, `GEN2`) or a significant transmission line, leading to a shortage of reactive power support in the area.
    *   Malfunction of voltage control equipment (e.g., tap changers, SVCs/STATCOMs) in the vicinity.
*   **Lightning Strikes:**
    *   Direct or indirect lightning strikes causing temporary flashovers or equipment damage that leads to a fault.
*   **Equipment Failure:**
    *   Insulation breakdown in cables, transformers, or switchgear connected to BUS 11 or adjacent buses.

## Possible Damages

A sustained voltage sag at BUS 11 can lead to various detrimental effects on the power system and connected equipment:

*   **Rectifier and DC Load:**
    *   **Malfunction/Tripping:** The rectifier may cease to operate correctly, leading to a loss of DC power to its load. Control systems within the rectifier might trip to protect components.
    *   **Component Stress/Damage:** Prolonged low AC input voltage can stress rectifier diodes (DIODE_BRIDGE) due to higher current ripple or lead to increased losses in the DC_LINK_CAP, potentially reducing its lifespan or causing failure. The DC load itself may malfunction or be damaged if its input voltage falls below operational limits.
*   **Downstream Loads (e.g., LOAD12, LOAD13, LOAD14):**
    *   **Equipment Malfunction:** Sensitive electronic equipment, industrial controls, and motors may malfunction, trip offline, or operate inefficiently.
    *   **Data Loss/Corruption:** Computers and data centers are highly susceptible to voltage sags, which can cause data corruption or system crashes.
    *   **Reduced Lifespan:** Repeated or prolonged exposure to sags can degrade insulation and reduce the lifespan of electrical equipment.
*   **Upstream Generators (GEN1, GEN2) and Synchronous Compensators (SYNC_COMP1, SYNC_COMP2, SYNC_COMP3):**
    *   **Overcurrents:** As voltage drops, loads may draw higher currents to maintain power, potentially stressing generators and lines with overcurrents if not properly protected.
    *   **Stability Issues:** Severe sags can lead to transient instability, potentially causing generators to lose synchronism or trip.
    *   **Compensator Stress:** Synchronous compensators may try to inject reactive power to support the voltage, potentially operating near their limits or experiencing increased stress.
*   **Transmission Lines (LINE10_11, LINE11_12):**
    *   **Increased Current:** If the sag is due to a fault, the fault current through these lines can be very high, potentially damaging conductors or insulators if protection fails.
    *   **Thermal Stress:** Even without a direct fault, increased load current during a sag (if loads attempt to maintain power) can cause thermal stress.
*   **Protection Systems:**
    *   **Misoperation:** Incorrectly set relays might fail to trip for severe sags or trip unnecessarily for minor ones, leading to wider outages or prolonged fault conditions.
*   **Overall System Stability:**
    *   **Cascading Failures:** A severe and unmitigated voltage sag can propagate, leading to voltage collapse in a wider area or triggering cascading outages.

## IEEE References and Nominal Ranges

*   **IEEE Standard 1159-2019 - Recommended Practice for Monitoring Electric Power Quality:**
    *   Defines a **voltage sag** (or dip) as a decrease in RMS voltage or current at the power frequency for durations from 0.5 cycles to 1 minute. The typical range for a sag is between 0.1 p.u. (10% of nominal) and 0.9 p.u. (90% of nominal).
*   **IEEE Standard 1668-2017 - Recommended Practice for the Characterization and Evaluation of Voltage Sag Behavior in Electric Power Systems:**
    *   Provides guidelines for characterizing voltage sag events, including magnitude, duration, and phase-angle jump, which are crucial for assessing their impact on equipment.
*   **Nominal Voltage Ranges (General Guidelines):**
    *   For most power systems, acceptable steady-state voltage is typically within **±5% to ±10% of the nominal voltage** (e.g., 0.9 p.u. to 1.05 p.u. or 0.9 p.u. to 1.10 p.u.).
    *   A voltage sag is specifically characterized by voltage dropping **below 0.9 p.u.** (90% of nominal). The severity depends on how far it drops and for how long. For example, a sag to 0.5 p.u. is more severe than a sag to 0.8 p.u.
