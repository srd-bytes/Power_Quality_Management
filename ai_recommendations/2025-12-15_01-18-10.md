### Recommendations

Given the ongoing voltage sag at BUS 11, which is connected to a rectifier and acts as an AC input for a DC system, the following recommendations are crucial:

1.  **Immediate Monitoring and Verification:**
    *   Continuously monitor voltage levels at BUS 11 and adjacent buses (BUS 10, BUS 12) using available measurements (VM11, VM10, VM12).
    *   Verify the magnitude and exact duration of the sag. A 20ms duration is very short, suggesting a momentary event or quick protection action.
    *   Check current measurements (IM11, IM10, IM12) for any abnormal spikes or dips that might indicate a fault current or load change.

2.  **Assess Impact on Rectifier and DC System:**
    *   Given that BUS 11 is the AC bus for a rectifier, assess the immediate impact on the rectifier's operation, the DC link capacitor, and the connected DC load.
    *   Check if the rectifier's control system is designed for ride-through capability for sags of this magnitude and duration.

3.  **Protection System Review:**
    *   Review the settings and operation of protective relays associated with BUS 11 and its connected lines (LINE10_11, LINE11_12).
    *   Ensure that protection schemes are coordinated to isolate any potential fault quickly without unnecessary tripping for short, non-damaging sags.

4.  **Fault Localization and Isolation (if applicable):**
    *   If the sag is severe or prolonged beyond the reported duration, initiate fault localization procedures.
    *   Depending on the severity and system configuration, consider isolating the affected section to prevent further damage or system instability, while maintaining supply to critical loads if possible.

5.  **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   For critical loads connected to BUS 11 (especially the rectifier and its DC load), consider implementing voltage sag mitigation devices such as Dynamic Voltage Restorers (DVRs), Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS), or Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOMs) if frequent sags are observed.
    *   Review the sensitivity of equipment at BUS 11 and downstream (BUS 12, BUS 13, BUS 14) to voltage sags.

6.  **Post-Event Analysis:**
    *   Once the sag clears, conduct a thorough root cause analysis.
    *   Analyze historical data for similar events to identify patterns or recurring issues.
    *   Inspect physical equipment in the vicinity of BUS 11 and connected lines for signs of damage or degradation.

### Possible Causes

Voltage sags are typically caused by short circuits or large load changes in the power system. Considering the system configuration, possible causes for a voltage sag at BUS 11 include:

1.  **Short Circuits:**
    *   **Faults on adjacent lines:** A temporary or permanent fault (e.g., single line-to-ground, line-to-line, three-phase) on LINE10_11 (connecting to BUS 10) or LINE11_12 (connecting to BUS 12).
    *   **Faults on upstream feeders:** Faults occurring further upstream in the network, for instance, on lines connected to BUS 10 (LINE9_10, LINE10_11) or even closer to the generators at BUS2 and BUS3.
    *   **Faults on parallel feeders:** If parallel feeders exist and one experiences a fault, it can cause a sag on the remaining healthy feeder due to increased current.
    *   **Faults on the AC side of the rectifier:** A fault within the rectifier's AC input circuit at BUS 11.

2.  **Load Switching/Starting:**
    *   **Starting of large motors or inductive loads:** If a large motor or inductive load (not explicitly detailed in the JSON but common in power systems) is switched on at BUS 11, BUS 10 (where LOAD10 is present), BUS 12 (where LOAD12 is present), or an adjacent bus, it can draw high inrush currents, causing a momentary voltage drop.
    *   **Energization of large transformers:** Switching on a large transformer can cause a temporary sag due to magnetizing inrush currents.

3.  **Capacitor Bank Switching:**
    *   Switching in a large capacitor bank can sometimes cause momentary overvoltages followed by sags due to transient oscillations, though less common for sustained sags.

4.  **Lightning Strikes:**
    *   A direct or indirect lightning strike on transmission lines or equipment near BUS 11 could cause a transient fault, leading to a voltage sag before protection operates. The 20ms duration is consistent with transient events.

5.  **Equipment Malfunction:**
    *   Malfunction of voltage regulators, tap changers on transformers, or other voltage control equipment could lead to a localized sag.

### IEEE References and Nominal Ranges

**IEEE References for Voltage Sags:**

*   **IEEE Std 1159-2019**: "IEEE Recommended Practice for Monitoring Electric Power Quality"
    *   Defines a voltage sag (or dip) as a decrease in the RMS voltage or current at the power frequency for durations from 0.5 cycles to 1 minute. The typical range for sag magnitude is between 0.1 pu and 0.9 pu of the nominal voltage.
*   **IEEE Std 1668-2017**: "IEEE Recommended Practice for Voltage Sag and Interruption Ride-Through for Industrial and Commercial Power Systems"
    *   Provides guidance on the immunity of industrial and commercial equipment to voltage sags and interruptions, and methods for improving ride-through capability.

**Nominal Voltage Ranges:**

*   **General Power System Voltage Tolerance:**
    *   For transmission and distribution systems, typical steady-state voltage variations are usually within **±5%** of the nominal system voltage.
    *   For some sensitive loads, stricter tolerances of **±3%** might be required.
    *   A voltage sag, by definition (IEEE 1159), indicates a voltage below 0.9 pu (90% of nominal).

*   **Example for a 1.0 pu nominal voltage:**
    *   **Nominal Voltage:** 1.0 pu
    *   **Acceptable Steady-State Range:** 0.95 pu to 1.05 pu (for ±5% tolerance)
    *   **Voltage Sag Range (as per IEEE 1159):** 0.1 pu to 0.9 pu (i.e., 10% to 90% of nominal voltage). A voltage below 0.1 pu is typically classified as an interruption.

### Possible Damages in the Context of a Power System

A voltage sag at BUS 11, even if brief (20 ms), can lead to various damages or operational issues, especially considering its connection to a rectifier:

1.  **Damage to Rectifier and DC Load at BUS 11:**
    *   **Rectifier Malfunction/Damage:** The sudden drop in AC input voltage can stress rectifier components (diodes/thyristors), potentially leading to overheating or failure, especially if the DC load attempts to draw constant power.
    *   **DC Link Capacitor Issues:** The DC link capacitor, "DC_LINK_CAP," might discharge rapidly, causing a dip in the DC voltage. Repeated rapid charge/discharge cycles can reduce its lifespan.
    *   **Control System Disturbance:** The rectifier's control system might malfunction, lose synchronization, or trip if its voltage ride-through capability is insufficient.
    *   **DC Load Impact:** The "DC_LOAD" connected to the rectifier will experience a drop in voltage and potentially current, leading to reduced performance, malfunction, or even damage depending on its sensitivity (e.g., if it's a critical process control system, motor drive, or battery charger).

2.  **Malfunction or Damage to Sensitive Electronic Equipment:**
    *   Any other sensitive electronic devices, control systems, or computers connected to BUS 11 or downstream buses (BUS 12, BUS 13, BUS 14) could experience data loss, corrupted files, system crashes, or hardware damage if they are not equipped with adequate voltage ride-through capabilities or UPS systems.

3.  **Motor and Electromechanical Equipment Issues:**
    *   If motors are connected to BUS 11 or downstream (e.g., part of LOAD12 or LOAD13), a voltage sag can cause reduced torque, leading to motors slowing down or stalling. Prolonged sags can cause overheating due to increased current draw to maintain mechanical power, potentially damaging windings.

4.  **Nuisance Tripping of Protective Devices:**
    *   If protective relays are set too sensitively or are not properly coordinated, a voltage sag, even a short one, can cause them to trip, leading to unnecessary outages and disruption of loads (e.g., LOAD12, LOAD13, LOAD14).

5.  **System Instability:**
    *   While a 20ms sag is typically too short to cause widespread instability, if it's a symptom of a larger, underlying system issue or if it triggers cascading events (e.g., widespread motor stalling), it could contribute to voltage instability or even collapse in a weaker part of the grid.

6.  **Production Losses:**
    *   In industrial settings, even momentary voltage sags can cause critical processes to stop, equipment to trip, or require manual reset, leading to significant production downtime and economic losses.
